**StarPilot** is a custom fork of [comma.ai's openpilot](https://comma.ai/openpilot),
an open source driver assistance system.

**This is the StarPilot 7.0 development branch (`SecretGoodStarPilot`). Feature migration,
vehicle qualification, and Auto Learn validation are still in progress.**

Openpilot provides
* Automated Lane Centering
* Adaptive Cruise Control
* Lane Change Assist
* Driver Monitoring *without wheel nags*

Ford-specific lateral-control and vehicle-support work includes substantial adaptations from
[BluePilot](https://github.com/BluePilotDev/bluepilot/tree/bp-7.0), principally developed by
[Alan Polk](https://github.com/alan-polk) with additional BluePilot contributors. StarPilot's
implementation has since diverged, but that does not erase its lineage. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)
for the code-level provenance and [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for applicable
upstream notices and terms. BluePilot and its contributors do not maintain or endorse StarPilot;
please direct support requests for this adaptation to the StarPilot project.

Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis angle steering and related vehicle support include substantial adaptations
from [sunnypilot](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/tree/hkg-angle-steering-2025) and its
[opendbc angle-steering branch](https://github.com/sunnypilot/opendbc/tree/hkg-angle-steering-2025).
StarPilot's implementation has diverged significantly; the upstream contributors do not maintain
this adaptation. Detailed code lineage is recorded in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## Documentation

Please see [https://wiki.firestar.link](https://wiki.firestar.link) for hardware lists,
installation guides, and software configuration.

## Features

* **Full support for Comma C3, C3X, and C4**
* Full support for chestnut/eGPU on C3, C3X, and C4. C3/C3X may require special gps handling.
* Model switcher with all of comma's tinygrad driving models
* StarPilot custom torque controller
* StarPilot custom longitudinal planner for both radar and VoACC (visual only, radar-less) vehicles
* **Custom tuning for an expanding list of vehicles**
* Firestar Lateral Method -
Auto tuning system to adapt openpilot to *your* car's unique lateral characteristics.
* Galaxy: StarPilot's portal to configure your comma device using your phone from anywhere.
Download models, change settings, update software, diagnostics, manage dashcam video, and more.
* Navigation - Display routes and give the driving model hints on taking exits and turns.
* Always On Lateral (full time steering assist)
* Lane Centering - Enable to center between detected lane lines,
with graceful fallback to model E2E lateral outputs and safety breakout
* Force Stop 2.0 - Better stops at stop signs and traffic lights.
* Speed Limit Controller - Use dashboard, map data, and/or vision detection for speed limit signs
* Curve Speed Controller - Learns from how you take curves
* Conditional Experimental Mode (CEM)
* Conditional Chill Mode (CCM)
* Driving Profiles and Traffic Mode
* Custom themes
* Alert volume customization
* Comma Pedal Interceptor support
* Bluetooth support - Connect keyboards, controllers, steering wheel remotes, and more.
* Sentry mode - Record when motion is detected while parked.
* V-ASM - Detect vehicles in the adjacent/blind spots using the driver-facing camera.
* Additional car support - Toyota SDSU, ZSS, CAN filter; pre-AP tesla; ford; Polestar 2; and more.
* And more!


## GM-only Features

* Increased LKAS fault resiliency
* ASCM_INT and SASCM support
* Custom lateral torque controller, with special tuning for Bolts
* 50% extra torque on 2017 Chevy Bolt
* Improved lateral and longitudinal tuning
* Dashboard cruise control display speed spoofing for vehicles with pedal interceptor
* Extra steering wheel button functionality for vehicles with pedal interceptor
* Optional toggle to boot comma when remote starting your vehicle

## Development

Dependencies are included as ordinary source folders. No recursive submodule checkout is needed. [upstream-sync.json](upstream-sync.json) records the openpilot baseline and the source revisions used for vendored dependencies.

The familiar development entry points are retained:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `./build` | Build the device software using the matching AGNOS environment |
| `./build --panda` | Build the supported Panda firmware targets |
| `./c3` | Open the comma 3 interface on a development host |
| `./c4` | Open the comma four interface on a development host |
| `./onroad` | Open the onroad development view |
| `./dev` | Use the isolated host development environment |
| `./test` | Run local pre-push regression checks without changing device artifacts |

See the [build guide](docs/how-to/laptop-device-build.md) for setup, prerequisites, and target-specific behavior. The [UI guide](openpilot/starpilot/ui/README.md) describes desktop previews and their limits.

## Testing and vehicle support

StarPilot retains upstream vehicle and Panda safety interfaces and adds regression coverage for its custom behavior. The [safety workflow](.github/workflows/safety.yaml) and feature tests cover distinct parts of the system. A passing interface test, model comparison, or bench run does not establish driving support for every configuration.

Support depends on the vehicle configuration and enabled feature. An existing vehicle identifier or settings page does not by itself establish driving support. Model Laboratory currently exposes management controls, but paired driving inference remains unavailable pending integration and Chestnut validation.
